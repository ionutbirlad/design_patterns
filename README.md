# Design Patterns ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/tsc?style=plastic?style=plastic&logo=typescript)

In this repo I wanted to replicate some design patterns as described in the book **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)** using Typescript.

## Installation

To compile the code into Javascript files Typescript installation is needed:

```bash
npm i -g typescript
```
or
```bash
yarn global add typescript
```

## Usage

To run the code go inside the pattern's folder that you want to reproduce and run the tsc command to compile all code into Javascript files, then simply run
```bash
node main
```
